# Blog Application
The idea of the project was to develop blog-like application with CRUD operations.
This project consists of 2 parts Backend(Groovy, Spring) and Frontend(React.js). It also uses postgreSQL as db.

## How to run
1. Install / Open postgres (pgAdmin).
2. Create db where data will be stored.
3. Open Groovy (Spring) project.
4. Go to blogweb\blogweb\src\main\resources
5. Open and edit application.properties. Specify your new db details.
```bash
spring.application.name=blogweb


spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ #your db
spring.datasource.username= #your db username
spring.datasource.password= #your db password

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true


```
6. Manually execute script to generate data for db. (In Intellij IDEA open DB Browser, connect to your db and run script)
```bash
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Blog (
    id int primary key GENERATED BY default AS IDENTITY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    section VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    likes INT NOT NULL,
    dislikes INT NOT NULL,
date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO Blog (title, content, author, likes, dislikes, section, date)
VALUES
    ('Friday Joke of the Day!', 'Why don''t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!', 'Jokester123', 50, 5, 'Joke', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
    ('New Tech Innovation Idea', 'Imagine a wearable device that monitors your health in real-time and provides personalized health advice.', 'TechThinker456', 40, 3, 'IT', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
    ('Question for the Community', 'What''s your favorite programming language and why?', 'CuriousCoder789', 60, 8, 'IT', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
    ('Reflecting on Life''s Moments', 'Life is about making memories and cherishing every moment with loved ones.', 'ReflectiveSoul', 70, 10, 'Lifestyle', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
    ('The Future of AI in Healthcare', 'Artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare by enabling faster diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and improved patient outcomes.', 'AIEnthusiast2023', 80, 15, 'Technology', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

```

7. Run Groovy application
8. Run React application ((in terminal, open the folder where the react application is located and run ```npm start```)
